## About the Video Course
Programming Android apps can be a complex process and lack of knowledge in architecting your app can result in spaghetti code and dead ends. In order to deliver an extendable, maintainable, and testable code base, you have to think about the architecture of your application from the very first stage of your development.
In this course, you’ll take an existing Android application build in Java and modernize it using the Kotlin language, seeing the importance of planning the architecture using SOLID principles and common Android Architecture using the MVP, MVC, and MVVM patterns. 
Moving on, you’ll implement Life Cycle Aware Components, use the viewmodel LiveData framework, and perform data management and persistence with the Room persistence solution. You’ll see how Kotlin efficiently accelerates the development by improving the code base. With the advanced Architectural Components, you’ll not only be able to improve the performance but also enhance the UI of your application to a whole new level.
By the end of this course, you’ll have modernized your Android app using all the new features from coding it in Kotlin to implementing Architecture Components to enhancing the UI of your app, which gives you more control on your app and makes it easy to maintain.
